    /// value.
    ///
    /// # Overview
    ///
    /// To do a call you must use the following protocol: first, the function
    /// to be called is pushed onto the stack; then, the arguments to the call
    /// are pushed in direct order; that is, the first argument is pushed first.
    /// Finally you call ``LuaState/call(argCount:resultCount:multipleResults:)``;
    /// `argCount` is the number of arguments that you pushed onto the stack.
    /// When the function returns, all arguments and the function value are
    /// popped and the call results are pushed onto the stack. The number
    /// of results is adjusted to `resultCount`, unless `multipleResults` is `true`.
    /// In this case, all results from the function are pushed and `resultCount` is ignored;
    /// Lua takes care that the returned values fit into the stack space, but it
    /// does not ensure any extra space in the stack. The function results are
    /// pushed onto the stack in direct order (the first result is pushed first),
    /// so that after the call the last result is on the top of the stack.
    ///
    /// Any error while calling and running the function is propagated upwards
    /// (with a `longjmp`).
    ///
    /// The following example shows how the host program can do the
    /// equivalent to this Lua code:
    ///
    /// `a = f("how", t.x, 14)`
    ///
    ///  Here it is in Swift:
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// let lua = LuaState()
    ///
    /// lua.getGlobal("f") // function to be called
    /// lua.pushLiteral("how") // 1st argument
    /// lua.getGlobal("t") // table to be indexed
    /// lua.getField(-1, "x") // push result of t.x (2nd arg)
    /// lua.remove(L, -2) // remove 't' from the stack
    /// lua.pushInt(L, 14) // 3rd argument
    /// lua.call(L, 3, 1) // call 'f' with 3 arguments and 1 result
    /// lua.setGlobal("a") // set global 'a'
    /// ```
    /// Note that the code above is balanced: at its end, the stack is back to its
    /// original configuration. This is considered good programming practice.

    ///   - argCount: Amount of arguments that were pushed onto the stack.
